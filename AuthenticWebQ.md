# Questionnaire 

Answer these questions using your familiarity with __<a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/10/credibility-tech/">Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment on the Web</a>__ (Section 4). Consider your tool as a link in the credible web ecosystem. 

1. Logistics. Provide a brief description of your proposal. How can we contact you? In what time zone are you located? Please link to Github repos, proposals, explainers, or drafts that youâ€™ve written.

2. What problem(s) are you trying to solve? What use cases are you addressing? How do you define credibility? Describe the actors involved.

3. Explain the chain of events that help assess credibility in your proposal. What architectural choices have you made that enable this?

4. Which role(s) does your proposal fill in the ecosystem (noting that some tools fill multiple roles):
* Content Consumer - Person receiving the information (audience, reader)
* Content Provider/Source - Person(s) or organizations delivering content 
* Content Promoter - Person(s) or organization that amplify the spread of information
* Credibility Facilitator - Person(s) or organization who is helping the consumer decide what to trust.
* Platform - Technological system, and by extension the person or organization who maintains and controls it. 

5. Which <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/10/credibility-tech/#h.32pkwj5grlt3">technical approaches</a> do you enable? Are there other ecosystem players that enable the technical approaches with which you will interoperate? Please elaborate
* Inspection
* Corroboration
* Reputation
* Transparency

6. Describe how your tool works technically.

7. Describe the user experience and the user research that went into development. 

8. Provide any research or evidence supporting the effectiveness of your tool.

9. What aspects of your proposal would benefit from being standardized? With which systems does it need to interoperate? How will this fit into existing technical and social systems (e.g. browser extension, peer review)?
 
10. Create a threat model for your proposal. Are there potential unintended consequences, such as enabling censorship or increasing bias? What are potential attack vectors? What can be done to mitigate these risks?

11. What do you hope for from W3C in this effort?
