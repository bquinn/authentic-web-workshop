This repository holds materials related to the [Authentic Web mini-workshop series](https://www.w3.org/events/workshops/2025/authentic-web-workshop/), including the framework used to review technology proposals in this area (based on the Credible Web Community Group's [report on Technological Approaches to Improving Credibility Assessment on the Web](https://www.w3.org/2018/10/credibility-tech/)), and minutes from the meetings organized to that end.

Future meetings in the series will be [announced in this repo](https://github.com/w3c/authentic-web-workshop/discussions/1) where you can subscribe to be notified of related announcements.

Please use issues to give feedback on the framework or suggest topics that the meeting series should address.
